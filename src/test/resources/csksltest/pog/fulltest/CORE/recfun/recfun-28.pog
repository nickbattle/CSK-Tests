Proof Obligation 1: (Unchecked)
Obligation for missing measure function
foo: recursive function obligation in 'A' (/home/nick/eclipse.vdmj/CSK-Tests/target/test-classes/csksltest/pog/fulltest/CORE/recfun/recfun-28.vdm) at line 16:19
(forall x:nat &
  (let bla = [1, 2, 3] in
    (true =>
      measure_foo(x) > measure_foo(bla(2)))))
