# CSK-Tests

This is a private repository of JUnit tests that were automatically produced from an original set of tests for VDMTools, created by CSK Corp. The CSK tests were converted to apply to the VDMJ tool.

The suite was created as a raw JUnit suite originally in 2008. It was subsequently converted to a Maven project in 2025.

The tests pass on the latest version of VDMJ (currently 4.7.0-SNAPSHOT).

The test suite can be executed with "mvn clean test" at the top level.
